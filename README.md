# WhatsPy

> Working as of Mar 09 2020

## limitations

- All web.whatsapp.com limitations
- Scan QRCode on first run
- You must have a persons number saved to your phone
- You must set the contact exact and complete saved name
- Names must be unique in your contacts list

## QRCode scan

A PNG file is saved at root directory as qrcode.png for scaning with yout phone. 
WhatsPy will try to save a profile so you don't need to scan the qrcode everytime.
Keep in mind that whatsapp logs you out if you try to login in multiple browsers.
